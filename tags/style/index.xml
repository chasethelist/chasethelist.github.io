      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve enrolled in a Lakme self-grooming class to enhance my makeup skills. I started with Crylons and now use top brands like MAC, Charlotte Tilbury, and Too Faced. Itâ€™s so much fun to transform and match my makeup with different outfits. I aim to get even better at it while boosting my self-confidence. ðŸ’„âœ¨&#xA;I want to enroll in personal hair styling course at Bombay School of Makeup which would cost me approximately 8000 Rs for 2 days program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
